HANZI stats
===========

A homework asignment at https://ksi.ff.cuni.cz, subject Linguistic Analysis of Chinese.

Basic quantitative analysis of chinese characters and their aspects in a given text:

type/token ratio, frequencies of radicals, of characters with multiple pronounciations, etc. Most of the information I use is from Unicode Unihan.
